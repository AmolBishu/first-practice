Heart Curve Simulation (Python Turtle)

This repository contains a Python script that draws a mathematical heart curve using Turtle Graphics.

The program is based on parametric equations involving trigonometric functions and demonstrates the graphical representation of mathematical curves using Python.

Requirements

Python 3

turtle module (built-in)

math module (built-in)

How to Run: 
python heart_sim.py


Running the script opens a Turtle Graphics window and renders the heart curve.

Description

The script computes x and y coordinates from parametric heart equations and plots them iteratively to form a smooth heart shape.

Usage

Intended for educational purposes, basic visualization, experimentation with mathematical curves, and personal creative use, including symbolic or expressive representations.
